*all of the below fits into the "constraints" array (an array of objects) in each district's file   
note: some of the notes that come along with any property may be confusing. Message me with qeustions and refer to "Minneapolis_superDistrict_0.0.9_07212022.json" file.
I abstracted the notes from studying the structure of that file.
    "constraintsModule": 
        type: array
        required: yes
        enum:[(every constraint is a possible value)]
    "lot":
        type: object
        properties:
            (any constraint module),
                note: a constraint module can theoretically live within any object within the "lot" object
            "districtTypeGroups": 
                type: array of objects
                object properties:
                    "districts":
                        type: array
                        enum: [any district identified in the 'municipality required info.json' file]
                        note: the "districtTypeGroups" property can exist within any property (after that property's required sub-properties) EXCEPT in development optionality
            "developmentOptionality":
                type: array of objects
                objects properties:
                    "developmentType":

                        type: object
                        properties:
                            "bulkOptionality":
                                type: array of objects
                                object properties:

                                        enum: [single-family, two-family, three-family. multi-family]
                                    (any constraint module)
                    "accessoryStructures"
                        type: object
                        properties:
                            "ADbulkOptionality":
                                type: array of objects
                                object properties:

                                    (any constraint module)
                                note: the "ADtypeOptionality" property can exist within any property within the "accessoryStructures" property
                            "bulkOptionality":
                                *see "bulkOptionality" definition above within the "primaryStructures" property under "DevelopmentOptionality"
                                note: the "bulkOptionality" property can exist within any property within the "accessoryStructures" property
